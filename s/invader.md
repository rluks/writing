# Invader Interview

*intro*

---

**Interviewer: Good morning, candidate R374 and welcome to the next round of interview in our hiring process. You've successfully passed previous 11 rounds and we're finally getting to the meat of it.**  
Candidate: Good morning, I'm so excited to finally meet with somebody in person! I enjoyed talking to all of your colleagues before you, as well as head hunters and talent agencies before that, nevertheless there were months that I haven't heard from anybody and almost lost all hope!  
**I: Yes, careful evaluation of each candidate is part of our hiring process. We don't want to make any rushed decisions, do we?**  
C: I wasn't sure I'll hear back from you at all. I received a message in which you thanked me for the interest in this position and informed me you decided to go forward with another candidate. I didn't lose all hope because despite being delivered to me, the message was addressed to candidate R377.  
**I: Well, you are here, R374, aren't you? Are you ready to get started? Would you like sustenance before we begin? Help yourself to yellow ones over there.**  
C: Delicious, now I'm ready to get started!  
**I: Excellent, first let me explain The Organization. We're looking looking for someone with a great cultural fit. You would join a Department of Invasion (DOI for short) with focus on rocky planets with up to two moons. You like moons, don't you, candidate?**  
C: Uhm…  
**I: Of course you do, otherwise you wouldn't pass the 5th round, would you?**  
C: Yes…?  
**I: Naturally, DOI doesn't operate in the vacuum. Department of Discovery regularly provides fresh planets suitable for invasions. Mind you, we do in fact operate in a vacuum of space. In your resume you proudly present that you have obtained Certified Space Invader certification. That's a nice to have certificate! Nevertheless, we are more interested whether you completed any vacuum training?**  
C: I was born in the vacuum.  
**I: Great, in that case it won't pose you any troubles to pass the training, would it? You should sign up for our Vacuum Sucks™ course as soon as possible. We offer substantial discounts for candidates such as yourself.** 
C: Training isn't part of the onboarding?  
I: No. Organization doesn't waste resources on something as trivial as onboarding. We only hire excellent candidates that will contribute immediately. It's in our stakeholder's best interest. Here, help yourself to a pamphlet.  
C: Thanks!  
**I: What do you know about The Organization?**  
C: I see organization mentions great company benefits. It's right here in the pamphlet!  
**I: We won't be discussing company benefits at this time. That's what the 17th round of hiring interview is for. Let me just say, from personal experience, the chance to serve in the organization is the greatest benefit one could ask for. Nobody asks or should ask for more. What else do you know about us?**  
C: Organization invades planets!  
**I: Is that all?**  
C: It's a big business. There are many rivals in this industry. Planets, moons, even entire solar systems are being auctioned away to highest bidders. Owners of planets set the rules and they may choose to rent it or create subdivisions to sell individually. New owners often terraform newly purchased planets to increase it's value. Of course nobody pays any attention to native inhabitants. If organization analysis team determines native inhabitants may pose a risk to a successful acquisition, it dispatches invasion to take care of it. And-  
**I: Excuse me, that's almost correct. In any case, we're not here to discuss planet trading industry. Now, let's talk about you, candidate. Tell me, why should we hire you?**  
C: Uhm… I'm a born invader!  
**I: What is your biggest weakness?**  
C: "I gotta be honest with you. Earlier, when said I like moons but truth is I'm more of a gas giant kind of guy. I don't mind a moon but two?! That's too much moon for me."  
**I: Thanks for sharing. Let's move on to your resume. Would you care to explain this gap in your professional experience?**  
C: I was a young spore and wanted to travel the galaxy. I wanted to expand my-  
**I: Thanks, we're getting a bit short on time because of your irrelevant and detailed description of planet trading. You do know that we have only 5 minutes, don't you?! Let's talk about your experience. Planet Invader Associate position requires 400 years of experience with invading planets. I don't see any experience of such sort in your resume. Would you care to comment on that?**  
C: Yes, I can't find a job to get the experience, and I can't get the experience without a job.  
I:    

# Pieces
C: Yes, I have questions. My fellow hatchling submitted resume with you previous month but haven't heart back from you at all, are they in the process?  
**I: I'm only responsible for the current batch of candidates and don't have any information of any other batches. Submitted resumes are processed automatically and any non-compliant are rejected without further action. As I mentioned before, Organization doesn't waste resources it would go against everything our shareholders believe.**   

C: Did I get the job?

**I: I really need to cut this short. I got a next round of interview in 2 months and need to prepare**
